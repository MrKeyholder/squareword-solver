1. What is Squareword?
Squareword is a square divided into cells. Words are written into cells in particular order.
The task is to fill empty cells with symbols from already given set so that in every horizontal,
vertical row and in every of two main diagonals there were no equal symbols.
For example:

 S L E Z A
 * * * * *
 * * L E S
 * * * * *
 * * * * *

 `*` indicate empty symbols that should be filled. Correct solution to this example is following:

 S L E Z A
 A E Z S L
 Z A L E S
 L Z S A E
 E S A L Z

2. TODO list:
- various tests
- more solving strategies
- solving of squarewords with more than one correct solution
- import-export functionality, currently only editing Main class string edit is working
- more functional-programming style for some code parts
