1. What is Squareword?
Squareword is a square divided into cells. "Words" are written into cells in particular order.
The goal is to fill in empty cells with letters from first row so that in every row,
column and in every of two main diagonals all letters are different. Variation of Sudoku, but with letters.

For example:

 S L E Z A
 ? ? ? ? ?
 ? ? L E S
 ? ? ? ? ?
 ? ? ? ? ?

`?` sign indicates empty cells that should be filled. 
Correct solution to this example is following:

 S L E Z A
 A E Z S L
 Z A L E S
 L Z S A E
 E S A L Z
